            <strong>CSIS 1280:</strong> <em>Multimedia Web Development</em> is a first level course
            where learn <strong><em>HTML5, CSS</em></strong> <em>and</em> <strong><em>JavaScript.</em></strong>
            It is really <del>cool!</del> <strong><ins>Awesome!</ins></strong>
            <br>
            The first lab is easy peasy though since we just need to create a simple page 
            with html tags.
            <br><br>
            We use <cite>Web Programming by John Dean</cite> as our textbook. Note that I refer 
            the textbook using the &lt;cite&gt; tag.

            Below is an example of a JavaScript function that handles an <em>onChange</em> event.
             Notice that JavaScript can be used to change the CSS <br> style and text content of 
            an elements. 
            <br>
            The code shown below is created using <em>code</em> and <em>pre</em> elements.
            <pre><code>

                function changeBg(){

                    var index = document.getElementById("colorsel").selectedIndex;
                    if(index &lt; 1)
                        alert("Please select one of the colors");
                    else{
                        var color = obj.options[index].value;
                        var obj2 = document.getElementById("td_text");
                        obj2.style="background-color: " + color;
                        obj2.childern[0].textContent = "My color is now " + color;
                    }
                }
            </code></pre>
